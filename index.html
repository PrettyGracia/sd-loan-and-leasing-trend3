        <h2>The Role of General Insurance</h2>
        <p>General insurance acts as a financial safety net, offering protection against unexpected losses due to accidents, theft, or natural calamities. Whether you are an individual or a business, having the right insurance plan helps mitigate risks and secures your assets.</p>

        <h2>Types of General Insurance Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home Insurance:</strong> Protects against damages caused by fire, weather conditions, and burglary.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial Insurance:</strong> Shields businesses from legal liabilities and operational risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto Insurance:</strong> Provides financial assistance in case of vehicle damage or third-party claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Insurance:</strong> Covers hospitalization and medical expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why General Insurance is Crucial</h2>
